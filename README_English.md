# My-Neuro - AI Character Customization Platform

## Project Overview

My-Neuro is an AI character customization platform designed for individuals, aiming to create your ideal AI companion through your data footprint.

This project is inspired by Neuro-sama, hence the name My-Neuro (a community-provided name). The project supports voice training, personality customization, appearance replacement, and other features. Your imagination is the only limit to how closely the model can match your expectations. This project is more like a workbench, using packaged tools to step by step personally describe and realize your ideal AI companion.

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 (Recommended)
- **Graphics Card**: NVIDIA GPU with at least 6GB VRAM
- **Memory**: At least 16GB RAM
- **Storage**: At least 50GB available space
- **Python**: Version 3.11
- **Conda**: Anaconda or Miniconda

### Important Notice

‚ö†Ô∏è **This project currently only supports NVIDIA graphics cards**. AMD graphics cards can be used but TTS functionality will report errors (no AI voice). You may try if you don't mind this limitation.

## Project Vision

My-Neuro is not just a simple chat interaction tool, but an emotional AI companion. We hope it can:

- Integrate into daily life and become an emotional individual
- Play games together, watch videos, learn things
- Chat before bed, wake you up, quietly accompany you while working
- Remember every moment experienced together with you
- Continuously understand you as a being

Most importantly, its personality, appearance, voice, emotional changes, etc. are all decided by you, like clay. We provide the best tools and module compatibility, but the final form is constructed by yourself.

For friends who don't want to tinker, this project also directly packages a character - Fat Beef (Fake Neuro). It's a character inspired by Neuro-sama, with a scheming, tsundere, funny personality with a small temper, but occasionally showing a gentle side.

The current project has implemented approximately **60%** of core features, including personality setting, memory, and basic real emotion systems. Recently, we'll focus on deep optimization of core personality traits to truly achieve human-like continuous emotions. The advanced emotional system will be implemented within 2 months, and the complete version will be finished before June 1st, reaching **85%** completion.
